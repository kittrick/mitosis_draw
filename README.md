# Mitosis Draw

### Evolving Illustrations
Itâ€™s an app that lets you draw with simulated cells! Made in processing and inspired by Daniel Shiffman. Each cell splits in simulated mitosis when it reaches a certain size, cells also inherit color information from their parents and mutate with each generation to create a continually evolving illustration.
